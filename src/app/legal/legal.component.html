    <h3 class="legal-subheading">Terms of Service</h3>
    <p class="legal-text">
        <strong>By joining BidNow, you’re part of the cool crowd!</strong><br>
        Yes, terms can be a snooze, but we’ve kept it simple for you. Here’s the TL;DR (because we know you’re busy bidding like a pro):
    </p>
    <ul class="legal-list">
        <li><strong>Play nice:</strong> No hacking, trolling, or villainous plots to overthrow the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep it clean:</strong> Spam belongs in the trash, not on BidNow.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect your fellow bidders:</strong> Think of this as a friendly game—be the kind of player others want to high-five, not block.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="legal-text">
        Stick to these, and you’ll be golden. Thanks for being the awesome human (or robot?) that you are!

    <h3 class="legal-subheading">Cookie Policy</h3>
    <p class="legal-text">
        <strong>We’re all about cookies (but not the snackable kind).</strong><br>
        While we wish these were warm, gooey chocolate chip cookies, they’re actually digital helpers designed to make your experience smoother than a freshly ironed shirt.
    </p>
    <ul class="legal-list">
        <li>Cookies help us remember your preferences (like whether you’re Team Dark Mode or Team Light Mode—no judgment).</li>
        <li>They make your experience on BidNow as delightful as a cat in a sunbeam.</li>
        <li>And no, they’re not here to stalk you. These cookies are friendly, not creepy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="legal-text">
        Love cookies? Great, just keep browsing. Not a fan? You can turn them off in your browser settings, but fair warning: BidNow might feel a little less magical without them.
